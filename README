# lilToon VAT Shader

This shader is a VAT (Vertex Animation Texture) system for the lilToon.

This is a custom shader of lilToon that ports the nekoVAT system by nekoya to lilToon.

Use original nekoVAT system by nekoya for creating VAT textures in blender.

## Notes
- Because of liltoon's problem, normals transformed by VAT may not be applied for outline rendering so
  you might see weird outline artifacts, especially when using mock object mode.
